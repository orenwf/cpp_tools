# CPP_TOOLS

## This is a small toolchain for c++ that I have written for practice. It utilizes some standard library functions to re-implement basic data structures and algorithms for the purpose of learning.

## Some of the classes include:
1. Raw data structures for use with advanced interfaces
⋅⋅*Circular, growable array class based on std::vector.
⋅⋅*Doubly linked list class
⋅⋅*Binary tree
⋅⋅*Binary heap
⋅⋅*Forward and backward iterators

2. Advanced Data Types
⋅⋅*Array Stack, Queue and Deque
⋅⋅*Linked List Stack, Queue, and Deque
⋅⋅*Binary search tree
⋅⋅*Priority Queue as a Max Heap
⋅⋅*Hash Map
⋅⋅*AVL Tree

3. Helper functions and Sorting Algorithms
⋅⋅*Random number generator
⋅⋅*test functions
⋅⋅*Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort
⋅⋅*Merge Sort, Quick Sort
⋅⋅*Bucket Sort, Heap Sort
⋅⋅*Radix Sort, Shell Sort
⋅⋅*Timsort, Introsort
⋅⋅*External Merge Sort
